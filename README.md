Hierarchical FSM library
===============

## overview

A hierarchical FSM library in C.
You describe the FSM with C struct(with function pointers as members) and provide the callback implementations. 
The library implements state movement and message(event) dispatch mechanisms.  

## Uasge

Compile/link the source code with your application. 

## Examples

Look into the "tests" directory.
Currently only a tiny, not complete USB FSM implementation is available.
